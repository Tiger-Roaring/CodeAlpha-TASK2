I'm excited to share that I have successfully completed Task 2 of my internship with CodeAlpha: Phishing Awareness Training.
This task was a deep dive into cybersecurity, where I learned to identify the tactics behind various phishing attacks and understand the importance of digital security in protecting information. It was a practical and insightful experience that has significantly strengthened my skills.
A huge thank you to CodeAlpha for this valuable learning opportunity. I'm looking forward to the next challenge!
